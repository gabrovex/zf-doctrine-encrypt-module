# Zend Framework & Doctrine Encrypt Module

Expands [51systems](https://github.com/51systems/doctrine-encrypt/) Doctrine encrypt repository. 

Provides a Zend Framework 3 & Doctrine 2 encryption module.

# Installation

    composer require salesupply/zf-doctrine-encrypt-module
    
# Requirements

 * PHP 7.2 or greater (must have Sodium extension enabled)
 * [Doctrine encrypt](https://github.com/51systems/doctrine-encrypt/) module by 51systems
 * [Doctrine ORM Module](https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine-orm-module/)
 
If you're on Windows, using Xampp, the PHP 7.2 installation might not automatically enable the Sodium extension. If this
the case, you'll get an error (`'This is not implemented, as it is not possible to securely wipe memory from PHP'`). 
Enable Sodium for PHP by adding this to your `php.ini` file:

    extension = C:\xampp\php\ext\php_sodium.dll

This might also be applicable ot other local installations.  

# Configuration

## Zend Framework

Make sure to add the module to you application configuration. In your `modules.config.php` make sure to include 
`ZfDoctrineEncryptModule`.

## Module

`*.dist` files are provided. Copy these (remove extension) to your application and fill in the required key/salt values. 
If these are filled in, it works out of the box using [Halite](https://github.com/paragonie/halite) for encryption. 

However, must be said, at the moment of writing this ReadMe, the Halite module contains duplicate `const` declarations,
as such, you must disable your `E_NOTICE` warnings in your PHP config :(

## Annotation Examples

### Encryption

Simple, consider that you have an `Address` Entity, which under upcoming [EU GDPR regulation](https://www.eugdpr.org/)
requires parts of the address, such as the street, to be encrypted. This uses the key & salt required for the config
by default

To encrypt a street name, add `@Encrypted` like so: 

    /**
     * @var string
     * @ORM\Column(name="street", type="string", length=255, nullable=true)
     * @Encrypted
     */
    protected $street;
    
By default the Encryption service assumes that the data to be encrypted is of the type `string`. However, you could have
a requirement to encrypt another type of data, such as a house number. Non-string types are supported, but the type of data
must be provided if not a string. You can do this like so:

    /**
     * @var int
     * @ORM\Column(name="house_number", type="integer", length=20, nullable=false)
     * @Encrypted(type="int")
     */
    protected $houseNumber;
    
Supported types are [found here](http://php.net/settype).

### Hashing

Say you'd like to store a password, it should work in much of the same way as the above. However, it is data that should
not be de-cryptable (and there's no need for it to ever be decrypted), thus you should hash it instead.

To hash something, like a password, add the `@Hashed` Annotation. See the example below.

    /**
     * @var string
     * @ORM\Column(name="password", type="text", nullable=false)
     * @Hashed
     */
    protected $password;
    
**Note** that, unlike `@Encrypted`, there aren't options to give a type. As we can't decrypt the data (it's one-way), 
there's no need to know what the original type was. The response will always be string value.

 ## Controller Examples
 
 ### Hashing
 
 A `Hashmanager` service is provided. This manager also uses the `HaliteHashingAdapter` but provides functionality that 
 can be used in Controllers and other classes, such as plugins. The service is registered under the alias 'hashing_service'.
 You can override 'hasing_service' in your own project to provide your own implementation. 
 
 The `HashManager` provides the ability to hash and verify strings. These are two separate operations, one one-way 
 hashes a string. The other does the same (requires the hashed string) and then verifies that both strings are 
 exactly the same (thus verifying).
 
 In a Controller, to hash a string, simple do:
 
     $secret = $this->getHashManager()->hash('correct horse battery staple')
     
 To verify that your dealing the same string a next time, for example to compare passwords on login, do:
 
     $verified = $this->getHashManager()->verify('correct horse battery staple', $secret)
     
 `$verified` will be set to a boolean value. 
 
 To not store any entered data longer than you must, you could compare directly from form data, like so:
 
     if($form->isValid() && $this->getHashManager()->verify($form->getData()['password_field'], $user->getPassword()) {
         // do other things
     }
